Role-Playing
=============================================================================

There are several role-playing quests that tell stories about different
characters or monsters, from the view-point of the respective creatures.
These typically take place in a dungeon, which you enter by dropping
special items on their altar. Afterwards, you're warped in, taking the
form of other characters.

Single-player

### Giant Spider

Talk to Deian about his "Private Story" while having a *White Spider Fomor
Scroll*, a *Red Spider Fomor Scroll*, and a *Black Spider Fomor Scroll* in
your inventory. He will give you the *Giant Spider Fomor Scroll*.

Drop the scroll onto the Alby dungeon altar to enter the dungeon as a Spider.
After opening the boss door you will meet the Black Wizard, who transforms
you into a Giant Spider. Afterwards you receive the keyword "Birth of the
Giant Spider" and you're warped out of the dungeon.

Go back to Deian and talk to him about the new keyword, you'll receive a
**Shepherd's Gathering Knife** as reward.
